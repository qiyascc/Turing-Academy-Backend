# Turing Academy Backend 

**DISCLAIMER:**  
My hands were tied while writing this, so I couldnâ€™t go into too much detail. But donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ve packed everything into a magical file called **`setup.sh`**! ðŸª„  

**How does it work?**  
- Open your terminal.  
- Type `bash setup.sh` (or `make setup` if you have it).  
- **BOOM!** ðŸŽ‰ Everything will be set up automatically. Your server is ready, just kick back and relax!  

**BUT WARNING!**  
If youâ€™re using **Apache** on your server, things might get a little messy because this magical script does everything with **NGINX**. Apache fans, step aside, itâ€™s NGINX time! ðŸš¨
